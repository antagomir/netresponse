## Extending the subnetworks

After identifying the locally connected subnetworks, it is possible to
search for features (genes) that are similar to a given subnetwork but
not directly interacting with it. To order the remaining features
in the input data based on similarity with the subnetwork, type

```{r NetResponse10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
g <- find.similar.features(res, subnet.id = "Subnet-1")
subset(g, delta < 0)
```

This gives a data frame which indicates similarity level with the
subnetwork for each feature. The smaller, the more similar. Negative
values of delta indicate the presence of coordinated responses,
positive values of delta indicate independent responses. The data
frame is ordered such that the features are listed by decreasing
similarity.
