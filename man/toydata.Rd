\format{Toy data: a list with three elements:

emat: Data matrix (samples x features). This contains the same features that
are provided in the network (toydata$netw). The matrix characterizes
measurements of network states across different conditions.

netw: Binary matrix that describes pairwise interactions between features.
This defines an undirected network over the features. A link between two
nodes is denoted by 1.

model: A pre-calculated model. Object of NetResponseModel class, resulting
from applying the netresponse algorithm on the toydata with model <-
detect.responses(D, netw).}
\usage{
data(toydata)

\description{
Toy data for NetResponse examples.
