for the corresponding mode)}

\item{ws}{weight for each mode}

\item{labels}{Optional: sample class labels to be indicated in colors.}

\item{modes}{Optional: provide sample modes for visualization already in

\item{pca}{The data is projected on PCA plane by default (pca = TRUE).
By setting this off (pca = FALSE) it is possible to visualize
two-dimensional data in the original domain.}
