\title{Find similar features with a given subnetwork.}
\usage{
find.similar.features(model, subnet.id, datamatrix = NULL, verbose =
FALSE, information.criterion = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{NetResponseModel object.}

\item{subnet.id}{Investigated subnetwork.}

\item{datamatrix}{Optional. Can be used to compare subnetwork similarity
with new data which was not used for learning the subnetworks.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether progress of the algorithm should
be indicated on the screen.}

\item{information.criterion}{Information criterion for model selection. By
default uses the same than in the 'model' object.}
}
\value{
A data frame with elements feature.names (e.g. gene IDs) and delta,
which indicates similarity level. See details for details. The smaller, the
more similar. The data frame is ordered such that the features are listed by
decreasing similarity.
}
\description{
Given subnetwork, orders the remaining features (genes) in the input data
based on similarity with the subnetwork. Allows the identification of
similar features that are not directly connected in the input network.
}
\details{
The same similarity measure is used as when agglomerating the subnetworks:
the features are ordered by delta (change) in the cost function, assuming
that the feature would be merged in the subnetwork. The smaller the change,
the more similar the feature is (change would minimize the new cost function
value). Negative values of delta mean that the cost function would be
improved by merging the new feature in the subnetwork, indicating features
having coordinated response.
}
\examples{
data(toydata)
model <- toydata$model
subnet.id <- "Subnet-1"
g <- find.similar.features(model, subnet.id)
# List features that are similar to this subnetwork (delta < 0)
# (ordered by decreasing similarity)
subset(g, delta < 0)
