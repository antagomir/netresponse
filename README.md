netresponse 
===========

Tools for functional network analysis (see the links for references):

 * [netresponse](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/21/2713)
   to detect and characterize context-specific activation patterns and
   to construct global functional maps of large interaction networks
   by combining functional information with interaction networks. The
   implementation is based on probabilistic models and variational
   learning.

 * [Interaction Component Model
   ICMg](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/4) for network
   module discovery taking into account the uncertainty in network
   structure. Can be supervised by functional information of the
   network.

The algorithms have been used to investigate the structure and
context-specific transcriptional activity of genome-scale interaction
networks in human body (see the links).

For further documentation, see the [package
vignette](vignettes/NetResponse.md).  

[Matlab
implementation](http://www.cis.hut.fi/projects/mi/software/NetResponse)
is also available but not supported.
