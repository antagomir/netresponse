CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.12 (2011-01-02)


BUG FIXES 

  o in internals.R some functions (mk.qOFz, mk.E.log.q.p.eta,
    mk.free.energy, mk.hp.posterior, mk.hp.prior, mk.log.lambda) were  defined
    multiple times.  Removed multiple copies. Also ensuring that no
    empty clusters are returned; this caused problems in split.qOFz
    and updatePosterior

OTHER CHANGES

o Code has been optimized for speed

o updated citation info

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3 (2010-10-03)

o Added slots 'datamatrix' and 'network' into NetResponseModel
  class. These are used to store the input data used to learn the
  model. Subsequently, removed data inputs from functions such as
  get.parameters etc. since now they can fetch the data matrix
  directly from the model object.

o Added project URL address to DESCRIPTION file

o Added 'speedup' option to vdp.mixt

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2 (2010-09-28)

o Fixed bug in C code. The previous version had convergence problems
  related to PCA initialization of component split during
  stick-breaking process, and mixture component centroids were
  subsequently not retrieved optimally 

o changed the output format of function vdp.mixt to focus on variables
  relevant for the end user.

o updated toydata and man pages according to the change to vdp.mixt output

o added test/demo.R testing and demonstrating vdp.mixt


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0 (2010-09-23)

o Improved man pages and examples

o Removed greedy and find.best.splitting from user-visible function
  space

o Added pre-calculated NetResponseModel object to toydata

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.4 (2010-09-17)

o Initial release.
