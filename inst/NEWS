CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.38 (2012-03-28)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
 o added the option to ignore network in detect.responses
    (netw=NULL); then the methods assumes fully connected
    network. Without speedups the performance may be very slow.

    ok

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.32 (2012-02-21)

  o added the option to ignore network in detect.responses
    (netw=NULL); then the methods assumes fully connected

    R-2.14

    confidence intervals and annotation colors

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.04 (2011-05-27)

BUG FIXES

  o fixed discretization NAMESPACE issues

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.02 (2011-05-18)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o added speedup option speedup.max.edges in detect.responses. To
    consider only this many most similar neighborghs in merging,
    similarity is evaluated by empirical mutual information estimate
    with sqrt(n) bins where n is data sample size

  o changed AIC to default information criterion (previously
    BIC). Both remain to be available through information.criterion
    argument

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.43 (2011-04-13)

  detect.responses:subgraph)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.37 (2011-04-06)

  o read.sif function improved 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.36 (2011-04-04)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    detect.responses)
           
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.35 (2011-04-04)

  o added functions for the ICMg (Interaction Component Model for finding
  Gene modules) package by Juuso Parkkinen

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.34 (2011-04-03)

  o fixed a bug in updatePosterior which caused halt; now trying to
     increase implicit noise for calculating free energy, if this does
     not help, merging of the investigated subnetwork pair is
     prevented (previously all calculations were stopped at this
     point, which is not practical)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.33 (2011-03-30)

  o added various information criteria for model selection to
    detect.responses and find.similar.features (AIC, AICc, BIC)
  o added vignette PDF windows buildcheck seems to require it

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.31 (2011-03-26)

  o polished vignette
  o optimized memory usage 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.29 (2011-03-23)

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o package: xadded support for reading in SIF network files through read.sif function
  o detect.responses: added support for igraph and graphNEL network
  formats; in detect.responses output the network is now also
  outputted in graphNEL format. This is more memory-efficient than
  previous implementation.

OTHER CHANGES

  o within detect.responses now handling the network through edge
    list; this is considerably more memory-efficient than previous
    implementation
  o added dependencies to graph and igraph packages

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.28 (2011-03-23)

  o made mixture density functions visible in NAMESPACE as this seems
    to be required in the new R version even if the functions are used
    internally.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.27 (2011-03-22)

  o removed nodes and samples from NetResponseModel output

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.26 (2011-03-22)

  o moved NetResponseModel functions in AllGenerics.R
  o removed intermediate matrices from detect.responses.R (costs,
    Nparams, bic.ind, bic.joint)
  o added two fields in pick.model.parameters: free.energy and Nparams
  o added internal function bic for bic calculations
  o removed costs from NetResponseModel output

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.22 (2011-03-13)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o added support for sparse matrices with the Matrix package (from 
    CRAN)


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.19 (2011-01-25)

BUG FIXES

  o now providing names for the elements in model@params list
  
USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o renamed result.stats into model.stats
  
  o now NetResponseModel also return the recalculated models for the
    responses. No need to recalculate them which speeds up analysis of
    the end results. Also useful since the result is not completely
    deterministic due to stochastic initializations in model learning
    etc., and relearning the models can sometimes produce slightly different results.  

NEW FEATURE

  o added find.similar.features function which can be used to find
    features (genes) that are similar to the subnetwork but not
    directly interacting with it

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.18 (2011-01-25)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  o in get.subnets function now using default min.responses=2
    and subnet.size=2 (at least 2 genes in a subnetwork)

  o added 'subnets' field to the NetResponseModel class. This lists
    the subnetworks by feature names.

BUG FIXES

  o NetResponseModel class now returns the original network used in
    the experiment (diagonal set to zero, however), previous version
    returned the agglomerated network

NEW FEATURES

  o added functions order.responses and order.samples

BUG FIXES

  o in result.stats function corrected the minimum responses filtering
    part

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.17 (2011-01-19)

  o users can now give the expression data D in either matrix or
    data.frame format to detect.responses function, which will
    automatically convert non-matrix inputs into matrix format.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.16 (2011-01-16)

BUG FIXES 

  o in the last step of the merging stage the network reduced into a
    numeric which caused error, now corrected by rejecting further
    operations with completely merged nets in detect.responses

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.15 (2011-01-15)

BUG FIXES 

  o in split.qofz minimum cluster size check added. clusters smaller
    than min.size cannot be splitted any more; this caused problems


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.13 (2011-01-07)

BUG FIXES 

  o in split.qofz speedup function added the line 'indices <-
    indices[rinds]'. Without this, an erroneous subset is selected and
    the program will eventually fail.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.12 (2011-01-02)


BUG FIXES 

  o in internals.R some functions (mk.qOFz, mk.E.log.q.p.eta,
    mk.free.energy, mk.hp.posterior, mk.hp.prior, mk.log.lambda) were  defined
    multiple times.  Removed multiple copies. Also ensuring that no
    empty clusters are returned; this caused problems in split.qOFz
    and updatePosterior

OTHER CHANGES

o Code has been optimized for speed

o updated citation info

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3 (2010-10-03)

o Added slots 'datamatrix' and 'network' into NetResponseModel
  class. These are used to store the input data used to learn the
  model. Subsequently, removed data inputs from functions such as
  get.parameters etc. since now they can fetch the data matrix
  directly from the model object.

o Added project URL address to DESCRIPTION file

o Added 'speedup' option to vdp.mixt

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2 (2010-09-28)

o Fixed bug in C code. The previous version had convergence problems
  related to PCA initialization of component split during
  stick-breaking process, and mixture component centroids were
  subsequently not retrieved optimally 

o changed the output format of function vdp.mixt to focus on variables
  relevant for the end user.

o updated toydata and man pages according to the change to vdp.mixt output

o added test/demo.R testing and demonstrating vdp.mixt


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0 (2010-09-23)

o Improved man pages and examples

o Removed greedy and find.best.splitting from user-visible function
  space

o Added pre-calculated NetResponseModel object to toydata

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.4 (2010-09-17)

o Initial release.
